#Sample website

This is a sample website made as part of
*Learn Enough Git to be Dangerous*
possibly the greatest beginner Git tutorial in the history of the Universe.
You should totally check it out
and be sure to join the email list and
follow @learnenough on Twitter.

After finishing *Learn Enough Git to be Dangerous*, I'll know enough git to be
*dangerous*. This means, I'll be able to use Git to track changes in my projects,
back up data, share my work with others, and collaborate with programmers and
other users of Git.
